# ImageNet Classification with Deep CNNs

This project implements and compares multiple deep-learning approaches for image classification using the Animals-10 dataset. It includes three parallel models:

- A custom PyTorch CNN
- A custom TensorFlow/Keras CNN
- A Hugging Face pretrained model for transfer-learning comparison

The main goal is to understand architectural differences, training behavior, and performance across frameworks.
