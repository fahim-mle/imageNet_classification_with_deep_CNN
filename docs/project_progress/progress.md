# Project Progress

## Completed Phases
- [x] **Phase 1: Setup**: Created `configs/pytorch.yaml`.
- [x] **Phase 2: Data Pipeline**: Implemented transforms and data loading.
- [x] **Phase 3: Model Architecture**: Implemented ResNet18 model creation.
- [x] **Phase 4: Training Pipeline**: Implemented training loop and basic evaluation.
- [x] **Phase 5: Entry Point**: Created `main.py`.
- [x] **Phase 6: Refinement**: Added `tqdm` progress bar.
- [x] **Phase 7: GPU Support**: Configured CUDA dependencies.
- [x] **Phase 8: Documentation**: Documented CUDA issues.
- [x] **Phase 9: Driver Verification**: Verified GPU usage.
- [x] **Phase 10: Evaluation & Metrics**: Implemented detailed evaluation script and CLI flags.

## Current Status
- PyTorch implementation is complete and verified on GPU.
- CLI supports `--train` and `--eval` modes.
- Evaluation generates JSON metrics and confusion matrix plots.

## Next Steps
- Implement TensorFlow/Keras pipeline.
- Implement Hugging Face pipeline.
